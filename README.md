# portfolio-api

api for my portfolio

## setup

If you are running on visual studio, make sure to launch using `portfolio-api`.

For any IDE, two environment variables are needed:

* DefaultConnection: `[database connection string]`
* TokenAuthentication_SecretKey: `[any secret string]`

Some example variables have been provided, but I recommend changing them to meet your needs.
